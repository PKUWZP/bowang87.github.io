However, biological networks are noisy due to the limitations of measurement technology and inherent natural variation, which can hamper discovery of network patterns and dynamics. We propose Network Enhancement (NE), a method for improving the signal-to-noise ratio of undirected, weighted networks. NE uses a doubly stochastic matrix operator that induces sparsity and provides a closed-form solution that increases spectral eigengap of the input network. As a result, NE removes weak edges, enhances real connections, and leads to better downstream performance. Experiments show that NE improves gene–function prediction by denoising tissue-specific interaction networks, alleviates interpretation of noisy Hi-C contact maps from the human genome, and boosts fine-grained identification accuracy of species. Our results indicate that NE is widely applicable for denoising biological networks.","tags":[],"title":"Network Enhancement: a general method to denoise weighted biological networks.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhishuai Zhang","Siyuan Qiao","Cihang Xie","Wei Shen","Bo Wang","Alan L Yuille"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1529380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529380800,"objectID":"15bfbda39d866e502de522a7cd8c933d","permalink":"/publication/semanticenrich/","publishdate":"2018-06-19T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/semanticenrich/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a novel single shot object detection network named Detection with Enriched Semantics (DES). Our motivation is to enrich the semantics of object detection features within a typical deep detector, by a semantic segmentation branch and a global activation module. The segmentation branch is supervised by weak segmentation ground-truth, ie, no extra annotation is required. In conjunction with that, we employ a global activation module which learns relationship between channels and object classes in a self-supervised manner. Comprehensive experimental results on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, with a VGG16 based DES, we achieve an mAP of 81.7 on VOC2007 test and an mAP of 32.8 on COCO test-dev with an inference speed of 31.5 milliseconds per image on a Titan Xp GPU. With a lower resolution version, we achieve an mAP of 79.7 on VOC2007 with an inference speed of 13.0 milliseconds per image.","tags":[],"title":"Single-Shot Object Detection with Enriched Semantics.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Wang","Lin Huang","Yuke Zhu","Anshul Kundaje","Serafim Batzoglou","Anna Goldenberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1507780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507780800,"objectID":"ed5a85c359a84d267e521aef5734f538","permalink":"/publication/vicus/","publishdate":"2017-10-12T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/vicus/","section":"publication","summary":"Biological networks entail important topological features and patterns critical to understanding interactions within complicated biological systems. Despite a great progress in understanding their structure, much more can be done to improve our inference and network analysis. Spectral methods play a key role in many network-based applications. Fundamental to spectral methods is the Laplacian, a matrix that captures the global structure of the network. Unfortunately, the Laplacian does not take into account intricacies of the network’s local structure and is sensitive to noise in the network. These two properties are fundamental to biological networks and cannot be ignored. We propose an alternative matrix Vicus. The Vicus matrix captures the local neighborhood structure of the network and thus is more effective at modeling biological interactions. We demonstrate the advantages of Vicus in the context of spectral methods by extensive empirical benchmarking on tasks such as single cell dimensionality reduction, protein module discovery and ranking genes for cancer subtyping. Our experiments show that using Vicus, spectral methods result in more accurate and robust performance in all of these tasks.","tags":[],"title":"Vicus: Exploiting local structures to improve network-based analysis of biological data.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Wang","Junjie Zhu","Emma Pierson","Daniele Ramazzotti","Serafim Batzoglou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488776400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488776400,"objectID":"9159c74bffd6eb6823635811ca47ceda","permalink":"/publication/single-cell/","publishdate":"2017-03-06T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/single-cell/","section":"publication","summary":"We present single-cell interpretation via multikernel learning (SIMLR), an analytic framework and software which learns a similarity measure from single-cell RNA-  seq data in order to perform dimension reduction, clustering and visualization.

Computational methods are needed to combine these data to create a comprehensive view of a given disease or a biological process. Similarity network fusion (SNF) solves this problem by constructing networks of samples (e.g., patients) for each available data type and then efficiently fusing these into one network that represents the full spectrum of underlying data. For example, to create a comprehensive  view of a disease given a cohort of patients, SNF computes and fuses patient similarity  networks obtained from each of their data types separately, taking advantage of the complementarity in the data. We used SNF to combine mRNA expression, DNA methylation and microRNA (miRNA) expression data for five cancer data sets. SNF substantially outperforms single data type analysis and established integrative approaches when identifying cancer subtypes and is effective for predicting survival.","tags":[],"title":"Similarity network fusion for aggregating data types on a genomic scale","type":"publication"}]
